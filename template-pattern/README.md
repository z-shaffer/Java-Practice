More Coins
Part 2 of coins assignment

Add patterns:
Template Method - makeCoin should be one. Double check relevant modifiers like
	 public, private, final, etc. for it and the "step" methods.
Visitor - We need to count NullCoins, and USD coins in the Coin purse.
Remote Proxy - Each coin needs a unique serial number. We obtain this number
       from the IMF remote object. See IMF_Coin_SN interface for details.
       When/where is the best place to get/use this??
